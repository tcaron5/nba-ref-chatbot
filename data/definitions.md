a. A team’s frontcourt consists of that part of the court between its endline and the
nearer edge of the midcourt line, including the basket and inbounds part of the backboard.
b. A team’s backcourt consists of the entire midcourt line and the rest of the court to

EXCEPTION: (1) kicked ball, (2) punched ball, (3) personal or technical foul on the

(3) a throw-in in the last two minutes of the fourth period and last two minutes of any
overtime period or (4) any time the ball is loose.

Section VII—Held Ball

A held ball occurs when two opponents have one or both hands firmly on the ball or
when a defensive player touches the ball causing the offensive player to return to the floor
with the ball in his continuous possession which would result in a traveling violation.

A held ball should not be called until both players have hands so firmly on the ball that
neither can gain sole possession without undue roughness. If a player is lying or sitting on
the floor while in possession, he should have an opportunity to throw the ball.

Section VIII—Pivot

a. A pivot takes place when a player, who is holding the ball, steps once or more
than once in any direction with the same foot, with the other foot (pivot foot) in contact with
the floor.
b. If the player wishes to dribble after a pivot, the ball must be out of his hand before
the pivot foot is raised off the floor. If the player raises his pivot off the floor, he must pass or
attempt a field goal before the foot is returned to the floor.

If he fails to follow these guidelines, he has committed a traveling violation.

Traveling is progressing in any direction while in possession of the ball, which is in

Section XI—Field Goal Attempt

A field goal attempt is a player’s attempt to shoot the ball into his basket for a field
goal. The act of shooting starts when, in the official’s judgment, the player has started his
shooting motion and continues until the shooting motion ceases and he returns to a normal
floor position. For jump shots, the shooting motion starts when the offensive player starts to
bring the ball upward towards the basket. On drives to the basket or other moving shots, the
shooting motion starts when the player gathers the ball and continues through with a shot
(except during a take foul situation when the clocks are not expiring, the shooting begins
when the player’s shoulders start upward). It is not essential that the ball leave the shooter’s
hand. His arm(s) might be held so that he cannot actually make an attempt.

The term is also used to include the flight of the ball until it becomes dead or is touched
by a player. A tap during a jump ball or rebound is not considered a field goal attempt. However,
anytime a live ball is in flight toward the rim from the playing court, the goal, if made,
shall count, even if time expires or the official’s whistle sounds. The field goal will not be
scored if time on the game clock expires before the ball leaves the player’s hand or the ball
is in flight toward the rim.

Section XII—Throw-In

A throw-in is a method of putting the ball in play from out-of-bounds in accordance
with Rule 8—Section III. The throw-in begins when the ball is given to and controlled by
the player inbounding, or at his disposal, and ends when the ball is released.

Section XIII—Last Two Minutes

When the game clock shows 2:00, the period is considered to be in the two-minute
period.

Section XIV—Suspension of Play

An official can suspend play for retrieving an errant ball, re-setting the timing devices,
delay-of-game warning, inadvertent whistle, instant replay, a seriously-injured player or any
other unusual circumstance. During such a suspension, neither team is permitted to substitute
and the defensive team may not be granted a timeout. Play shall be resumed at the point of
interruption.

EXCEPTIONS:
(1) Suspension of play for a player bleeding. See Comments on the Rules—N.
(2) Seriously-injured player. Player must be removed and opponent is permitted one
substitution.

Section XV—Point of Interruption

The Point of Interruption is where the ball is located when the whistle sounds.

Section XVI—Team Control

A team is in control when a player is holding, dribbling or passing the ball. Team
control ends when the defensive team deflects the ball or there is a field goal attempt.

Back to Top

Section XVII—Team Possession

A team is in possession when a player is holding, dribbling or passing the ball. Team
possession ends when the defensive team gains possession or the ball hits the rim of the
offensive team.

Section XVIII—Fumble

A player who is holding the ball and fumbles it out of his control may recover the ball.
If his pivot foot moves to recover the ball, he must then pass or shoot the ball. If he fumbles
and recovers it without moving his pivot foot and before the ball touches the floor, he retains
his status before the fumble.
