RULE NO. 7: Shot Clock
Section I—Definition

The ‘shot clock’ shall refer to the timing device that displays a countdown of the time within which the team possessing the ball must attempt a field goal. The shot clock shall start at 24 seconds unless otherwise provided in Rule 7. The shot clock shall be displayed in seconds, except tenths of seconds will also be displayed once the shot clock reaches 4.9 seconds.

Section II—Starting and Stopping of Shot Clock

The shot clock will start when a team gains new possession of a ball which is in play.
On a throw-in, the shot clock shall start when the ball is legally touched on the court by a player.
Following a jump ball or missed free throw, the shot clock shall start when new possession is obtained.
After gaining possession of the ball, a team must attempt a field goal before the shot clock expires. To constitute a legal field goal attempt, the following conditions must be complied with:
The ball must leave the player’s hand prior to the expiration of the shot clock.
After leaving the player’s hand(s), the ball must make contact with the basket ring.
A team is considered in possession of the ball when holding, passing or dribbling. The team is considered in possession of the ball even though the ball has been batted away but the opponent has not gained possession.
Team possession ends when:
The ball hits the rim of the offensive team
The opponent gains possession
If a ball is touched by a defensive player who does not gain possession of the ball, the shot clock shall continue to run.
If a defensive player is the last to touch the ball before going out-of-bounds or entering the basket ring from below, the shot clock is stopped and the offensive team shall be awarded the ball. The offensive team shall have only the unexpired time remaining on the shot clock in which to attempt a field goal. If the shot clock reads 0, a shot clock violation has occurred, even though the horn may not have sounded.
If during any period there are 24 seconds OR LESS left to play in the period, the shot clock shall not function following a change of possession; provided, however, the shot clock shall be reactivated and reset to 14 seconds when any of the situations described in Section IV—d below occur.
If an official inadvertently blows his/her whistle and the shot clock buzzer sounds while the ball is in the air, play shall be suspended and play resumed by a jump ball between any two opponents at the center circle, if the shot hits the rim and is If the shot does not hit the rim, a shot clock violation has occurred. If the shot is successful, the goal shall count and the ball inbounded as after any successful field goal. It should be noted that even though the official blows his/her whistle, all provisions of the above rule apply.
If there is a question whether or not an attempt to score has been before the shot clock expires, the final decision shall be made by the of See Rule 13—Section I—a—8.
Whenever the shot clock reads 0 and the ball is dead for any reason other than a defensive three-second violation, kicking violation, punched ball violation, personal foul or a technical foul by the defensive team, a shot clock violation has occurred.

Section III—Putting Ball In Play After Violation

If a team fails to attempt a field goal within the time allotted, a shot clock violation shall be called. The ball is awarded to the defensive team on the sideline, nearest the spot where play was suspended but no nearer to the baseline than the free throw line extended.
